# TeaCozyFlexBoxCodecademyProject
### The goal of this project is to Recreate the "Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy" from Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer Career Path
##### The code was done in one or two sittings but the challenge was to create as close of a website layout to the design spec as possible.
##### If there is anything I can do to refactor this code, please let me know so I can become a better programmer and designer in the process of my learning.
## The link to the design spec can be found here: https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg?_gl=1*pmj4u4*_ga*NDQ4OTI2Mzg5Ni4xNjc0MTA3NTE0*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY3NTExNDA0Mi4yMS4xLjE2NzUxMTQ2MjUuNTguMC4w 
##### Thank you for taking the time to read and comb through this beginner-level HTML5/CSS3 project!
